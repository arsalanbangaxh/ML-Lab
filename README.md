# Machine Learning Labs â€“ BS Electrical Engineering

This repository contains a series of Machine Learning lab exercises developed during the course of my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. These labs aim to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, focusing on algorithm development, data analysis, and model evaluation.

# Objective

The primary objective of these labs is to:
- Build a solid foundation in Machine Learning concepts
- Apply ML techniques to solve real-world problems
- Gain practical experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- Understand how ML integrates with electrical and embedded systems

# Topics Covered

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction)
- Model Evaluation and Optimization
- Introduction to Neural Networks

# Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- (Optional) TensorFlow / Keras for neural network labs

# Future Enhancements

- Implementation of ML models on embedded platforms (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
- Integration of Edge AI concepts using TensorFlow Lite or Edge Impulse
- Capstone project demonstrating ML for signal processing or IoT applications
